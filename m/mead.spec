%description
MEAD is a set of software objects for the purpose of modeling the
electrostatics of molecules using a semi-macroscopic picture in
which the solvent and the molecular interior have different
dielectric constants, the boundary between the different
dielectric regions is dependent on the detailed atomic structure
of the molecule, and the electrostatic potential is determined by
the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. This version of MEAD includes
modeling of a membrane as a low dielectric slab, possibly with a
water-filled channel through a protein in the membrane.

MEAD is written in C++, which is a significant departure from most
molecular software, which is more commonly written in Fortran or
(recently) C.  My purpose in choosing C++ was to explore the
object-oriented programming style that C++ facilitates and to make
a software system that other people could borrow pieces from and
make extensions to in a convenient way.
