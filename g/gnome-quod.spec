%description
Quod, a game invented by G. Keith Still, has simple rules, but playing well
requires sophisticated strategy. The goal of the game is to place pieces on a
grid so that they make a square. The player who makes a square first wins.
Squares can be any size and orientation, and players have a limited supply of
blocking pieces, which adds to the complexity and interest.
