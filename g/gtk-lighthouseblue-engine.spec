%description
This is the LighthouseBlue GTK2 Engine that was removed in the 2.8.x releases
of gtk-engines. I took a GIT snapshot of the tree right before the engine was
removed, made a few modifications, and stripped the tarball down to the bare-
bones, so it won\'t clobber your more up-to-date GTK engines when you install it.
