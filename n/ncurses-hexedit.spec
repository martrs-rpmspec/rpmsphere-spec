%description
Curses Hexedit is a full screen hex editor using the curses, ncurses , or pdcurses library. Some of it's features are:
    GPL'd. It's Free Software.
    Familiar setup, similar to Nortan's Diskedit
    File Selection widget for selecting a file to edit.
    Editing and Viewing disks in Linux and OpenBSD.
    Allows Inserting and Deleting bytes from the file.
    Highlights changes in the file in bold.
    Fast boyer-moore string and byte searches.
    Undo - keeps track of all changes, reverting back to original always possible.
    Start of a base conversion/calculator utility built in.
    Portable. This should run on any platform with a dialect of the curses library
    I'll support it. I wrote in all the features I wanted. Anything missing? I'll probably add it in.
