%description
Have you ever wanted to run a tiny, safe web server without worrying about
using a fully blown web server that could be complex to install and configure?
Do you wonder how to write a program that accepts incoming messages with a
network socket? Have you ever just wanted your own Web server to experiment
and learn with?

Well, look no further -- nweb is what you need. This is a simple Web server
that has only 200 lines of C source code. It runs as a regular user and can't
run any server-side scripts or programs, so it can't open up any special
privileges or security holes.
