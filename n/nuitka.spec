%description
Nuitka is **the** Python compiler. It is a seamless replacement or
extension to the Python interpreter and compiles **every** construct
that CPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 have. It then executed
uncompiled code, and compiled code together in an extremely compatible
manner.

You can use all Python library modules or and all extension modules
freely. It translates the Python into a C level program that then uses
"libpython" to execute in the same way as CPython does. All optimization
is aimed at avoiding overhead, where it's unnecessary. None is aimed at
removing compatibility, although there is an "improved" mode, where not
every bug of standard Python is emulated, e.g. more complete error
messages are given.
