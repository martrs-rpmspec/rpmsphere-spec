%description
Tablix is a powerful free software kernel implementing a parallel genetic
algorithm. It can be used to solve a large subset of discreet multivariable
optimization problems, but is specially optimized for timetabling. Because of
its modular design it is relatively simple to adapt Tablix to needs of a
specific organization.

Input and output is in form of specially formatted XML files, which can be
exported to a variety of formats including HTML for publishing on the web and
Comma-separated values suitable for import into other applications and further
processing. New formats can be added by writing custom export modules.
