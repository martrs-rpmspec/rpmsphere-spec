Summary: Hard-core shoot 'em up game in blue-or-red world
BuildRequires:  SDL_image-devel, libXpm-devel

%description
tenmado is a vertically scrolling, late 1990s style (that is, a massive number
of enemy shots against a smaller-than-it-looks spaceship) shoot 'em up game.
A very accurate collision detection makes it a game of dexterity. If something
looks like a triangle, it is a triangle, not a rectangle of similar size.

However, surviving is only 20% of the game. The main feature of tenmado is the
"color chain bonus". You can get a very big score (about 100 times bigger than
a normal enemy-destruction point) by destroying enemies of the same color
successively. It is easy or difficult depending on how greedy you are.
