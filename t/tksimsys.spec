%description
Tksimsys was written to offer a convenient way to build and simulate
biocybernetic systems. From the pull-down menu you can choose an element,
give it a value and an order. There are different input functions, conductors,
dividers, connectors, characteristics and output channels. The value of many
variables could be changed interactively. After start it shows the
output curves, which could be stopped on the way or directed to standard output.
You could also load, save, shift and print the models designed.
