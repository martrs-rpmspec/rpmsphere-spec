%description
Tempora LGC Unicode is a font family, designed to provide a free
typeface suitable for word processing in languages which use 3 European
alphabets: Latin, Greek and Cyrillic. It may be especially useful for
philologists (mainly slavists and classicists), since it supports
historical Cyrillic letters available in the Unicode standard (including
letters used in Russian  pre-1918 orthography) as well as all accented
combinations and additional characters needed for fully accented Greek
(both classical and modern). Tempora LGC Unicode is a "smart" font,
intended to demonstrate nicities of the OpenType technologie, applicable
to European scripts.
