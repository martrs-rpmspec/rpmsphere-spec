Ddrutility is meant to be a compliment to gnuddrescue. It is a set of
utilities to help with hard drive data rescue. It currently contains
the following utilities:
        ddru_findbad
        ddru_ntfsbitmap
        ddru_ntfsfindbad (NEW)

        Changes in version 2.5
                Some of the code has been restructured to allow for sharing of functions.
                Ddru_ntfsbitmap & ddru_ntfsfindbad - Both are now able to properly process non 512 byte sectors. They both can also now handle partial MFT errors,
                 meaning if the second sector of the record is bad and the record size fits in the first sector it will now process it instead of totally rejecting it.
                Ddru_ntfsbitmap - Fixed a bug where the MFT domain output file would end up with an error (same error that was fixed in domain output file previously).
                Ddru_ntfsbitmap & ddru_findbad - Both are now able to process the older NTFS filesystem from Windows NT and 2000.
        Changes in version 2.4 (released May 15 2014)
                Ddru_ntfsbitmap - Added option --restart to delete all important files from the previous run before starting. This is used to help prevent any issues from old
                 files causing bad results.
                Ddru_ntfsbitmap - Fixed a bug where the domain output file would end up with an error when using the --inputoffset option and the partition start position was
                 equal or less than what was considered the "first track" (63 sectors).
                Ddru_ntfsfindbad - Fixed a bug where files were falsely reported as having errors if the start or finish was right next to an error sector.
                 They would be listed but with a 0 byte error size.
                Ddru_ntfsfindbad - Fixed a bug in the debug output where the offset and full offset were not correct.
        Changes in version 2.3
                Ddru_ntfsfindbad - Fixed a bug where some file or folder names were in DOS 8.3 instead of Win32 format in the output.
                Ddru_ntfsfindbad now properly converts NTFS file names from UTF-16 to UTF-8, as opposed to just processing every other byte. This should allow for multi-language
                 support in the output. Added the option "--encoding" to be able to choose the filename output encoding, if needed to be different from the default of UTF-8.
                Ddru_ntfsfindbad - Added option --noconvert to turn off the new encoding option. This has been added in case of strange program crashes caused by the very buggy iconv.
                 When used, this option uses the old method of every other character for the file names, which will work for ASCII.
