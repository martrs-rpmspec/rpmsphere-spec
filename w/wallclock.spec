%description
wallclock is a Bash script which will display wallpaper clocks on computers
running Linux with the GNOME desktop environment. It is designed to be run
using the cron job scheduler, so users must add a line to their crontab file
to run the script. Setting up the wallclock script does not take long and
detailed step-by-step instructions are available so that users unfamiliar
with editing their crontab file can easily set the script up.
