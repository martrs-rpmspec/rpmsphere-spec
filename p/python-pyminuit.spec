%description
PyMinuit is an extension module for Python that passes low-level Minuit
functionality to Python functions. Interaction and data exploration is more
user-friendly, in the sense that the user is protected from segmentation
faults and index errors, parameters are referenced by their names, even in
correlation matrices, and Python exceptions can be passed from the objective
function during the minimization process. This extension module also makes
it easier to calculate Minos errors and contour curves at an arbitrary number
of sigmas from the minimum, and features a new N-dimensional scanning utility.
