%description
PhotoFilmStrip is a software to make movies out of your pictures in just 3
steps. First select your photos, customize the motion path and render the
video. There are several output possibilities for VCD, SVCD, DVD up to
FULL-HD. The effect of the slide-show is known as "Ken Burns". Comments of the
pictures are generated into a subtitle file. Furthermore an audio file can be
specified to setup the background music for the slide show. It has also the
opportunity to render slide shows in Full-HD (1920x1080) resolution.
