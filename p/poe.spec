%description
Currently it's roughly functionally equivalent to PE2. The .dir file isn't yet
supported, though .keys and .unknown are. As I get more time to work on it I'll
push it farther along. Profile handling will be changing quite a bit. I want to
do undo in a different way than PE2 did it and different from the way other
programmers editors do it (with an undo/redo stack); both methods have their
advantages and I'd like to get the best of both worlds.
