PHYML is a software implementing a new method for building phylogenies
from DNA and protein sequences using maximum likelihood. Data sets can
be analysed under several models of evolution (JC69, K80, F81, F84,
HKY85, TN93 and GTR for nucleotides and Dayhoff, JTT, mtREV, WAG and
DCMut for amino acids). A discrete-gamma model (Yang, 1994) is
implemented to accommodate rate variation among sites. Invariable
sites can also be taken into account. PHYML has been compared to
several other softwares using extensive simulations. The results
indicate that its topological accuracy is at least as high as that of
fastDNAml, while being much faster.
