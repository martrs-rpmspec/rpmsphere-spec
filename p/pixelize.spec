%description
Pixelize works by splitting up the image you want rendered (or duplicated) into
a grid of small rectangular areas. Each area is analyzed, and replaced with an
image chosen from a large database of images. Pixelize tries to pick images that
best match each area.

Pixelize works best when it can choose images from a very large database of images.
With about 1000 images, Pixelize can do a reasonable job.
