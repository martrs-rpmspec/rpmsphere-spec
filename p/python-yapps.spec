%description
Yapps (Yet Another Python Parser System) is an easy to use parser generator
that is written in Python and generates Python code. Although there are several
parser generators already available for Python, I had different goals,
including learning about recursive descent parsers. Yapps is simple, is easy to
use, and produces human-readable parsers. It is not fast, powerful, or
particularly flexible. Yapps is designed to be used when regular expressions
are not enough and other parser systems are too much: situations where you may
write your own recursive descent parser.
