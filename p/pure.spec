%description
Pure is a modern-style functional programming language based on term rewriting.
It offers equational definitions with pattern matching, full symbolic rewriting
capabilities, dynamic typing, eager and lazy evaluation, lexical closures,
built-in list and matrix support and an easy-to-use C interface. The interpreter
uses LLVM as a backend to JIT-compile Pure programs to fast native code.

Pure is the successor of the author's Q language. It offers many new and powerful
features and programs run much faster than their Q equivalents. It also
integrates nicely with a number of other computing environments, most notably
Faust, Pure Data, Octave, Reduce and TeXmacs. A fairly extensive collection of
addon modules is available, which makes Pure usable as a compiled scripting
language for a variety of purposes.
