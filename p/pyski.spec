%description
Imagine you are skiing down an infinite slope, facing such hazards as
trees, ice, bare ground, and the man-eating Yeti! Unfortunately,
you have put your jet-powered skis on backwards, so you can't see
ahead where you are going; only behind where you have been. However,
you can turn to either side, jump or hop through the air, teleport
through hyperspace, launch nuclear ICBMs, and cast spells to call the
Fire Demon.  And since the hazards occur in patches, you can skillfully
outmaneuver them. A fun and very silly game that proves you don't need
fancy graphical user interfaces to have a good time.
