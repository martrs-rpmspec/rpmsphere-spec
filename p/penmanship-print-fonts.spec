%description
Ruled manuscript font has solid caps and baseline rules and dashed x-height
rule. Can't quite identify this style. It differs from the standards I've found
in several ways: thinner, J has top horizontal stroke, straight tail on q
(no hook), shorter ascenders and descenders, G includes an extra vertical stroke.
Yet still has a very school-like appearance.
