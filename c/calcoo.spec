%description
Calcoo is a scientific calculator designed to provide maximum usability. 
The features that make Calcoo better than (at least some) other calculator 
programs are:

  * bitmapped button labels and display digits to improve readability
  * no double-function buttons - you need to click only one button
    for any operation (except for arc-hyp trigonometric functions)
  * undo/redo buttons
  * both RPN (reverse Polish notation) and algebraic modes
  * copy/paste interaction with X clipboard
  * display tick marks to separate thousands
  * two memory registers with displays
  * displays for Y, Z, and T registers
