%description
ChaiScript is one of the first (and perhaps only) embedded scripting
language designed from the ground up to directly target C++. Being
a native C++ application, it has some advantages over existing
embedded scripting languages: it uses a header-only approach, which
makes it easy to integrate with existing projects; it maintains
type safety between your C++ application and user scripts; and it
supports a variety of C++ techniques including callbacks, overloaded
functions, class methods, and STL containers.
