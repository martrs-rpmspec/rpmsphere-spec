%description
The Connect-k family of games contains games defined by three parameters: k, p,
and q. The game is played on a Go-style (but not necessarily size) board. There
are two players, black and white, who take turn placing stones on the board.
The first player (black) plays q stones on the first turn and each player then
plays p stones on every succeeding turn. The first player to form a horizontal,
vertical, or diagonal sequence of k stones wins.
