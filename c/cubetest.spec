%description
This program was written for a competition from Linux Magazine. The competition
was held because of a lack of good educational software for primary schools.
The program CubeTest is aimed at primary school students. With it, you can train
your spatial insight.

vraagMost people know the type of question: a cube is shown together with four
alternatives. The objective is to point out the cube that is identical to the
one shown. The cubes from which you can choose are oriented differently from
the first cube and one has to turn the cubes mentally in order to decide which
ones are the same.

These question are a great way of improving your spatial insight. This is a
valuable asset in many technical areas. In adition it's just plain fun to
answer these questions and no matter how often you practice, they never become
really easy.
