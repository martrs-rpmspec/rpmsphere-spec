%description
FOR KDE 3.5 LOVERS!!! These icons are from Everaldo:
https://www.everaldo.com/crystal/ and I just revived the old icon theme:
https://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Crystal+SVG+Icons?content=24758
because a lot of icons were not working properly, I edited a couple of icons,
but the credits design is for Everaldo and his project.
