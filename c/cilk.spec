%description
Cilk is a language for multithreaded parallel programming based on ANSI
C. Cilk is designed for general-purpose parallel programming, but it is
especially effective for exploiting dynamic, highly asynchronous
parallelism, which can be difficult to write in data-parallel or
message-passing style. Using Cilk, our group has developed three
world-class chess programs, StarTech, *Socrates, and Cilkchess. Cilk
provides an effective platform for programming dense and sparse
numerical algorithms, such as matrix factorization and N-body
simulations, and we are working on other types of applications. Unlike
many other multithreaded programming systems, Cilk is algorithmic, in
that the runtime system employs a scheduler that allows the performance
of programs to be estimated accurately based on abstract complexity
measures.
