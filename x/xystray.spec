%description
Xystray is a simple implementation of freedesktop.org systray
specification (a.k.a notification area) for XWindow system. It is meant
for use in simple desktop environments which does not provide such
facility by default eg. FVWM. It may also run under GNOME or KDE but
the default tray programme has to be disabled then.
