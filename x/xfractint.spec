%description
Fractint is a freeware fractal generator created for IBMPC's and compatible computers.
It is the most versatile and extensive fractal program available for any price.
The authors (of which I am not one), work very hard to keep it that way.
It has many great features and it is constantly being upgraded and improved by the Stone Soup team.
Keep this link as a reference to stay up-to-date with the latest developments.
