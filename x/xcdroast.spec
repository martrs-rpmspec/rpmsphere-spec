%description
X-CD-Roast is a flexible frontend for optical disc authoring.
It combines command line tools like "cdrecord", "cdda2wav", ?readcd"
and "mkisofs" into a nice GTK based graphical user interface.

  * Fix crash when deleting exactly 50 or a multiple of 50 tracks.
  * Change code to use g_io_channels. (Prepare for GTK3)
  * More GTK3 migration.

    more than a decade and thus X-CD-Roast cannot be programmed for OS X.
  * Rewrite child processing.
  * More GTK3 migration.
  * Rewrite dialog window placement.
  * Modernize code to display the xcdroast logo (cairo instead of
    pixbuf). Also improve the logo quality.

  by Mathias Büttner:
  * Disabled the write mode selector for DVD (and BD) media in "Create"
    and in "Duplicate" menu.
  * Disabled "Do not fixate" for multisession writes (not just a warning).
  * Added fixed settings for nofixate and multisession in "Duplicate" menu
    as they can't be changed there.
  * Updated write mode settings and write options for cdrecord.
  * Fixed displaying wrong Disc size if no Audio CD or Mixed Mode CD.
  * Added notification if CD-Text will not be written.
  * Placed a small logo on top of the sidespace buttons.
  * Amended some of the old tooltips.
  * All terms talking about a CD (Compact Disc) are changed simply to
    the word Disc or CD/DVD/BD where meaningful. (by Mathias Büttner)
  * Resized Dialog windows
  * Removed checks for older cdrecord features
  * Replaced all GtkText by GtkTextView (modernize design)
  * Convert all translation files to UTF-8
  * Replace GtkFileSelection by GtkFileChooser (modernize design)
  * Code cleanup/formatting by Mathias Büttner
  * rename non-root-mode to user-host-mode, as we now always allow
    non-root users to start X-CD-Roast. The user-host-mode just allows to
    configure which user on which host can use X-CD-Roast.
    (e.g. for computer science labs or server installations)
  * detect the suid-bit settings on the cdrtools or the X-CD-Roast wrapper
    and offer a dialog to fix this automatically
  * Changed JEDEC prefixes to decimal and binary prefixes according to
    IEC 60027-2 (January 1999) to avoid confusion. (by Mathias Büttner)
  * Paranoia mode: auto setup of lowest read ahead buffer for each drive
    when scanning for new devices (by Mathias Büttner)
  * wrong cdrtool versions are now reported in a dialog window
    (not just as a warning in the terminal)
  * set suid bit on xcdrwrap on 'make install'
  * Fix various gdk-assertion failures
  * Fix resize of Read/Write progress window
  * Added new checkbox "audio deemphasis" (by Mathias Büttner)
  * Updated gettext to 0.19.7
  * Updated to autoconf 2.69
  * Update to autmake 1.14.1
  * use cddb protocol 6 instead of 1, this fixes also charset problems
  * Compile by default without non-root-mode. Currently I rely on
    that the cdrtools have the suid bit already set.
  * charset conversion from ISO8859-1 to UTF-8 on Album or Track titles.
  * merged in all patches I received and published on my webpage
    since X-CD-Roast 0.98alpha16. - Many thanks to all contributors!
    (parse_version.patch, change_norwegian_locale.txt, io_compile.patch,
    cdda2wav_version.patch, fix_cddb_hidden_tracks.patch, io_progressbar
    _fix.patch, format-security.patch, suid-perms.patch)
  * removed --enable-gtk2 option, this is enabled by default now.
  * Renamed norwegian translation file from "no" to "nb".
  * Updated galician translation.
  * Lots of input and patches and motivation for an updated xcdroast version
    by Mathias Büttner from southwestern Germany:
  * updated CD/DVD writer/reader default settings in setup menu.
  * removed the outdated slider "sectorburst" and added instead
    "size of read ahead buffer" and "minimum overlap of sectors"
    for paranoia mode in the setup menu.
  * added new checkbox "suppress a hidden audio track"
  * fixed info output and track increment in GTK-window
    'Reading audio tracks' for cdda2wav in paranoia mode.
  * changed cdrtools version check to allow only v3.02a09 or higher
    because v3.00a01 - v3.02a07 contain a bug and v2.01 is very outdated
    and may even not compile nowadays.
  * fixed xcdroast's mkisofs version detection since v3.02a01.
  * changed german translation to new orthography.
