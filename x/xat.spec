%description
Xat is an application that serves as an intermediary between the X clients and
a multiheaded X server. Xat deceives its clients who have the impression  that
the server has only one head. The objective is that each head behaves, of  the
client's point of view, as a separate X server.  We  can  imagine  a  scenario
where we have a xserver on display :1 with four screens (:1.0, :1.1, :1.2  and
:1.3). After Xat being connected we have four displays (:2, :3, :4 and :5) and
just one screen per display. This makes multiseat viable if we  introduce  the
Multi-Pointer X server (MPX) to take care of all input devices.
