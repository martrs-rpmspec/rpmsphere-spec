%description
xxxterm is a minimalist web browser with sophisticated security features
designed-in (rather than through an add-on). In particular, it provides both
persistent and per-session controls for scripts and cookies, making it easy
to thwart tracking and scripting attacks.

In additional to providing a familiar mouse-based interface like other web
browsers, it offers a set of vi-like keyboard commands for users who prefer
to keep their hands on their keyboard.

The default settings provide a secure environment. With simple keyboard
commands, the user can "whitelist" specific sites, allowing cookies and
scripts from those sites.
