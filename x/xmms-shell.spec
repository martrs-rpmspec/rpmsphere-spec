%description
XMMS-Shell is a simple utility for controlling XMMS externally.
Although XMMS itself provides some similar functionality, XMMS lacks a
few important command line options to allow one to perform certain
tasks, such as volume control, easily manipulating a playlist, and
more. XMMS-Shell is intended to make up for these deficiencies.
