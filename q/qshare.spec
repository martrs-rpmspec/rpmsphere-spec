%description
qShare is a FTP server with a built-in service discovery feature that makes
qShare clients aware of other clients running on the same network. It also
supports Zeroconf on Linux. You can easily add/remove folders from the shared
folders list, set access rights, toggle password protection, etc...
 
The most useful feature is probably the file search feature. The built-in FTP
server implements a FIND command used by qShare to look for files on all known
computers of the network with very little network/CPU overload.
