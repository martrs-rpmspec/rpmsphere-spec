%description
J. Aroche's Vienna3 for CursorXP, converted to an X11 cursor.
Javier has agreed on providing me a ubuntu logo animation for the 'AppStarting'
animation, previously has a Windows logo. Some animations have been changed to
ones that don't cause glitches on the desktop when compiz-fusion is enabled,
and the "hand" image has been replaced with a much more interesting animation
from J.Aroche. Link to Original for CursorXP:
