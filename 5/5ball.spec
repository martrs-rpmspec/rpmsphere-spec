%description
5ball is a simple logic game. The goal of the game is to make the
maximum number of lines with balls of the same color. A line is
made of five balls. Each time you don't do a line, extra balls
appear on the grid. You loose when the grid is full.

This is a logic game, lining up 5 balls of like color to get them
off a grid, to keep the grid from filling up. Requires 1024x768
or better screen resolution.

It looks a lot like klines, but with bigger balls. 5ball is
actually a modification of gtkBalls (a game similar to klines but
with several features giving it loads of potential -- but somewhat
lacking in the UI department.) All the other 'Lines' games I have
tried were too small on a decent screen. This one is big and the
chicks think it's sexy. Yeah.
