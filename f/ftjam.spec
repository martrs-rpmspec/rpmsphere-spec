%description
Jam is a small open-source build tool that can be used as a replacement for Make.
Even though Jam is a lot simpler to use than Make, it is far more powerful
and easy to master. It already works on a large variety of platforms
(Unix, Windows, OS/2, VMS, MacOS, BeOS, etc.), it is trivial to port,
and its design is sufficiently clear to allow any average programmer to extend it
with advanced features at will.

This is an improved version, named ‘FT Jam’, containing several enhancements
(like the ability to run on Windows 9x systems, or additional compiler/toolset support).
