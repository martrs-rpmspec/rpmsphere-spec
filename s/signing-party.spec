%description
PGP Tools is a collection for all kinds of pgp related things, including
signing scripts, party preparation scripts etc.

caff is a script that helps you in keysigning. It takes a list of
keyids on the command line, fetches them from a keyserver and calls
GnuPG so that you can sign it. It then mails each key to all its email
addresses - only including the one UID that we send to in each mail.

pgp-clean takes a list of keyids on the command line and outputs an
ascii-armored keyring on stdout for each key with all signatures
except self-signatures stripped. Its use is to reduce the size of keys
sent out after signing. (pgp-clean is a stripped-down caff version.)

gpg-key2ps will output a PostScript file which has your Key-ID, UIDs
and fingerprint nicely formatted for printing paper slips to take with
you to a signing-party.

Given one or more key-ids, gpg-mailkeys mails these keys to their
owners. You use this after you've signed them. By default, the mails
contain a standard text and your name and address as the From (as
determined by the sendmail command).

gpglist takes a keyid and creates a listing showing who signed your
user IDs.

gpgsigs was written to assist the user in signing keys during a
keysigning party. It takes as input a file containing keys in gpg
--list-keys format and prepends every line with a tag indicating if
the user has already signed that uid.

keylookup is a wrapper around gpg --search, allowing you to search for
keys on a keyserver. It presents the list of matching keys to the user
and allows her to select the keys for importing into the GnuPG
keyring.

%changelog
* Fri Jul 27 2012 Wei-Lun Chao <bluebat@member.fsf.org> - 1.1.4
- Rebuilt for Fedora
* Thu Mar 22 2012 cfarrell@suse.com
- license update: GPL-2.0+
  Various Open Source Licenses is not acceptable as a spec file license.
  For this package, GPL-2.0+ seems to be the most accurate license choice
* Wed Mar 14 2012 joop.boonen@opensuse.org
- Build version 1.1.4
  * gpg-key2ps:
    + Apply patch from Uwe Kleine-KÃ¶nig to deal with latin1 characters
  * gpg-mailkeys:
    + Correct path of ~/.gpg-mailkeysrc and ~/.signature in manpage.
    + Add new environment variable SENDMAIL_ARGS to allow user to pass
    arguments to sendmail
  * caff:
    + Correct path of ~/.caffrc in informational messages
    + Be more verbose on unexpected key ID
    + Refactor import of own key and import for keys to sign from keyrings.
    + Also automatically import keys to sign from the user's normal gpg
    keyrings.
    + Use --no-auto-check-trustdb when importing keys from files or
    the user's normal gpg keyrings
    + manpage: Refer to all of /usr/share/doc/signing-party/caff/ and not
    just to /usr/share/doc/signing-party/caff/caffrc.sample
    + Fix horrible &function calls used because of broken prototypes.
    + Even if all keys to sign were found in the user's normal gpg
    keyrings we still need to import them (again) from any keyrings
    passed with --key-files - the keys there might be newer, containing
    new subkeys (for encryption), uids (for signing) or revocations.
    + Make importing of keys to be signed from the normal gpg optional
    (--keys-from-gnupg).
    + refactor copying of command line options into global config variable.
    + Create the mail files in ~/.caff/keys even if mail is not sent
