%description
Siren is a text-based audio player for UNIX-like operating systems. Various
aspects of Siren have been inspired by cmus. Siren is distributed under the ISC
licence.

Siren supports Ogg Vorbis, MP3, FLAC, WavPack, WAVE, AIFF and a few other file
formats. Playback is possible through sndio, PulseAudio, OSS, Sun audio and
libao. Siren has been tested on OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD and Linux.
