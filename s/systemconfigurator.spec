%description
Provides an API for various installation and configuration processes that are
otherwise inconsistent between the many Linux distributions, and the many
architectures they run on.  For example, you can configure the bootloader
on a system in a general way - you don't need to know anything about the
particular boot loader on the system.  You can update the network settings
of a system, without knowing the distribution or the format of its network
configuration files.
