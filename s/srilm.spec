Summary:        SRI Language Modeling Toolkit

%description
SRILM is a toolkit for building and applying statistical language models (LMs),
primarily for use in speech recognition, statistical tagging and segmentation,
and machine translation. It has been under development in the SRI Speech
Technology and Research Laboratory since 1995. The toolkit has also greatly
benefitted from its use and enhancements during the Johns Hopkins
University/CLSP summer workshops in 1995, 1996, 1997, and 2002.
