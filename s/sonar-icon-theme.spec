%changelog
* Sun Apr 28 2013 Wei-Lun Chao <bluebat@member.fsf.org> - 11.3.1
- Rebuilt for Fedora
* Fri Mar  1 2013 dimstar@opensuse.org
- Spec-cleanup using format_spec_file service.
* Tue Jan 18 2011 vuntz@opensuse.org
- Remove the gtk3-metatheme-sonar subpackage (and all references to
  it in various Suggests): we can't build it this way anymore,
  since theming in GTK+ 3 changed and the format is different. We
  might create a gtk3-metatheme-sonar package again later, but with
  a working GTK+ 3 theme.
* Tue Jan 11 2011 vuntz@opensuse.org
- Add gtk2-metatheme-sonar-main-menu-theming.patch: correctly match
  the main menu button for theming. With the relevant change in
  gnome-main-menu, this fixes bnc#642956.
* Thu Oct 14 2010 vuntz@opensuse.org
- Create a theme for gtk3 too:
  + copy gtk-2.0 theme directory as gtk-3.0, it should just work.
  + create a gtk3-metatheme-sonar subpackage.
  + split the common files between gtk2-metatheme-sonar and
    gtk3-metatheme-sonar in metatheme-sonar-common. This subpackage
    is required by both gtk2-metatheme-sonar and
    gtk3-metatheme-sonar. It also has a sonar-icon-theme
    Recommends, and Suggests for both gtk2-metatheme-sonar and
    gtk3-metatheme-sonar.
  + change gtk2-metatheme-sonar Recommends in sonar-icon-theme to a
    Suggests, and add a gtk3-metatheme-sonar Suggests too.
  + remove gtk2 Requires for gtk2-metatheme-sonar:
    gtk2-engine-murrine will already bring gtk2.
* Thu Sep 23 2010 badshah400@gmail.com
- Add metatheme-Sonar_compatibilty-with-murrine-0.98.patch to
  remove options deprecated in murrine 0.98, that create warnings.
* Wed Aug 25 2010 vuntz@opensuse.org
- Add hicolor-icon-theme BuildRequires.
- Use the %%icon_theme_cache_* macros to make sure the icon theme
  cache is created/updated.
* Sat Aug  7 2010 vuntz@opensuse.org
- Drop icon-theme-gilouche.patch: the size of the icon theme is now
  reduced, so we don't need this anymore.
- Change sonar-icon-theme Suggests to Recommends: the sonar icon
  theme is the one that is recommended by the theme, and this will
  make it easier to have it installed by default.
* Wed Jun 30 2010 vuntz@opensuse.org
- Update sonar-icon-theme to 11.3.1: this version removes many
  icons that are now part of gnome-icon-theme (since 2.30.0).
* Thu Jun 24 2010 psankar@opensuse.org
- Change recommended icon theme to Gilouche in the metatheme file,
  as 11.3 does not ship sonar-icon-theme by default because of size
  constraints.
* Thu May 13 2010 jimmac@novell.com
- metatheme 11.3.0 - use Sonar icon theme again
- icon theme 11.3.0 - add 24x24px size for volume icons. bug #602871
