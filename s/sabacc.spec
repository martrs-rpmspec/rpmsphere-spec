%description
Sabacc is a game originally found in the Star Wars universe. 
It is similar in many ways to the game of Blackjack/Twenty-one
/Pontoon, with a number of differences:
    * It is played with a special deck of 76 cards, some of which
      are negative.
    * The aim of the game is to score as close as possible to 
      positive or negative 23 without exceeding it.
    * At any point during the game, a number of cards can change 
      values, meaning that a winning hand can instantly transform 
      into a losing hand or vice-versa.

Although these are the main differences, Sabacc actually has a 
complicated set of rules which differ in many ways to those of 
Blackjack. It is recommended that you familiarise yourself with 
them before starting to play Sabacc.
