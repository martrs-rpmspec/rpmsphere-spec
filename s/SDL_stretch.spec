%description
Providing stretch and blit routines for SDL surfaces.
These are optimized for speed including lots of assembler parts
in the general routines and dynamic cpu native code generation
for applications to compile specialized stretch-and-blit routines
at runtime.

%description devel
While hacking on UAE (the unix amiga emulator) I did develop a few
stretching routines. I have been asking on the SDL mailing list for any
prior art but it seems that no one did wrap such routines into a
library part that can be reused everywhere. Other projects are
just game SDKs which tend to wrap such routines it into their
own framework - instead of using vanilla SDL surface. Also, there
are only rare pieces of assembler optimized routines. I took some
of these as hints and created my own set of highly optimized routines
pumped up with assembler - stretch-and-blit routines for SDL on steroids.
