%description
As part of a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grant from the National
Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the NIH, we are developing and
making available open source code for ECG analysis. Initially, we released
open source code for C functions that are useful for QRS detection. We then
released an initial version of software for beat classification which builds
on our QRS detection software. This release includes three QRS detector
versions (including a version for implementation on a PIC 16F877), software
for beat classification, software to facilitate testing ECG analysis software,
and software documentation.
