%description
Oh is a reimagining of the Unix shell as a programming language. Oh provides:
* Lexical scope;
* Exceptions;
* First-class channels, pipes, environments and functions;
* A list type (no word splitting);
* Rich return values that work with standard shell constructs;
* Kernel-style fexprs (allowing the definition of new language constructs);
* Support for modularity;
* A simplified set of evaluation and quoting rules; and
* A syntax that deviates as little as possible from established conventions;
