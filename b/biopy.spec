%description
This is not a high-duty, high-performance library. It is a set of functions for
exploration and development of phylogenetics. Useful for generating simulated
data or performing off-line analysis as well. Some parts are specific to *BEAST
and BEAST.

This code should work with Python 2.5 and up. For full functionality the
following packages are requited: numpy, scipy, lxml and biopython.
