%description
C code creates a postscript file that is fed to ghostscript
to create a pnm file that is scaled to 50% with pnmscale to
antialias and then converted to png by pnmtopng, and the original
postscript output file is converted to pdf by ghostscript's
ps2pdf14.

You'll need ghostscript installed in addition to netpbm for
the other tools. Ghostscript itself could have been used to
create a png, but the output file was much larger and the
resulting image was not as visually appealing.
