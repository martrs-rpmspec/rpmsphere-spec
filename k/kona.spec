%description
Kona is the open-source implementation of the K programming language. K is
a synthesis of APL and LISP. Although many of the capabilities come from APL,
the fundamental data construct is quite different. In APL the construct is
a multi-dimensional matrix-like array, where the dimension of the array can
range from 0 to some maximum (often 9). In K, like LISP, the fundamental data
construct is a list. Also, like LISP, the K language is ASCII-based, so you
don't need a special keyboard.
