%description
This Cursor theme has been made by J.Aroche, it has been converted by me to
a X11 Cursor. Also included are 4 different versions, blue, green, red, yellow.
The 'busy' animation has been changed on all four versions, since the original
is too big and doesn't integrate well with compiz-fusion enabled.
