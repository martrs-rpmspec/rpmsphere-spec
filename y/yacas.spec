%description
YACAS is an easy to use, general purpose Computer Algebra System, a
program for symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions.

It uses its own programming language designed for symbolic as well as
arbitrary-precision numerical computations.

The system has a library of scripts that implement many of the symbolic
algebra operations; new algorithms can be easily added to the library.

YACAS comes with extensive documentation (320+ pages) covering the
scripting language, the functionality that is already implemented in
the system, and the algorithms we used.
