%description
UDE - The Unix Desktop Environment is more then just
another windows manager. Designed to compensate for
the shortcomings of many other similar packages, UDE
features many innovative improvements. The project does
not use any special GUI-Libraries such as QT or GTK+ and
is based on the standard Xlibs (also to make UDE faster).

- Rebuilt for Fedora
* Sat Jun 9 2001 Christian Ruppert <arc@gmx.li>
- Added package description
- Updated URL
- configure.in shold be now set up in a way so that building rpms should work
  for releases, not for snaps (where we use <SNAP$(shell date +%d%m%Y)> as
  version string which works fine for makefiles but not for rpm.spec).
