Name: liblogging
Version: 0.7.1
Release: 4.1
Group: Development/Libraries/C and C++
License: BSD
BuildRequires: dos2unix
URL: https://www.liblogging.org/
Source: liblogging-%{version}.tar.bz2
Summary: An easy to use, portable, open source library for system logging

%description
The original idea was to provide a very slim BEEP look-alike to implement with
a few hundered lines of code. Well, during development new ideas popped up and
the design goal now has evolved to provide a library useful for all kinds of
system logging.

Liblogging is unique in the way that it was specifically designed for system
logging and ease of use. There are many BEEP libraries out there and most of
them support the syslog reliable RAW profile. However, these libraries have a
very complex API, which is overdone just for logging. Software implementors
stay away from those libraries. We hope that liblogging will make reliable
syslog available to everyone. There is a very short, easy to use and learn API.
