%description
Liboop is a low-level event loop management library for POSIX-based 
operating systems. It supports the development of modular,
multiplexed applications which may respond to events from several
sources. It replaces the "select() loop" and allows the
registration of event handlers for file and network I/O, timers and
signals. Since processes use these mechanisms for almost all
external communication, liboop can be used as the basis for almost
any application.

# no .so extension. Quite bizarre. - AdamW 2008/12
