%description
First and foremost to make things clear: LBreakoutHD is an HD remake 
of LBreakout2 (all levelsets and themes will work). The game itself is
completely unchanged. A new SDL2/C++11 view has been added to support 
16:9 wide screens of any resolution. Why not adding this to the existing
LBreakout2 package if the game basically remains the same? Because 
second: I wanted to clean up the code (the not really well working 
network stuff bothered me) and not mix SDL2 with SDL for dependencies.

So LBreakoutHD is a clean cut with the old core engine (still in C) and
a brand new fully scalable 16:9 view.
