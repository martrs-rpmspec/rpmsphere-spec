%description
A library for a rendering mikumiku dance pmd model and vmd motion files.
The original sourcecode is part of the windows program MMD_Desktop (v0.4.9): https://r13n.spaces.live.com
which in turn took its sources from ARTK_MMD (v0.7), which can be found under https://ppyy.hp.infoseek.co.jp/artk_mmd.html
Both MMD_Desktop and artk-mmd are released under the GPL-2 license, so I assume that putting this lib under GPL-2 too is ok.
The code in this archive is almost unmodified, just some linux changes and switch to a shared library (changes are included as a diff).
I changed the code to a shared lib, as there are several other opensource programs which (could) make use of the code.
