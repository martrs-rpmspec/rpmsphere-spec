%description
ELFIO is a C++ library for reading and generating files in the ELF binary format.
This library is unique and not based on any other product. It is also platform
independent. The library uses standard ANSI C++ constructions and runs on a wide
variety of architectures. 

While the library's implementation does make your work easier: a basic knowledge
of the ELF binary format is required. Information about ELF is included in the TIS
(Tool Interface Standards) documentation you received with the library's source code.
