%description
This is a library making it easy to patch applications to send commands to
PWMD. Features include:

* Thread safe (POSIX and libpth2 (optional) supported)
* Asynchronous pinentry when threading isn't possible
* Secure remote connections over SSH using libssh2
* Secure memory functions which applications may also use

Read libpwmd.h or libpwmd(3) for all the details. There is an included
command line client 'pwmc' that reads protocol commands from stdin and sends
them to the pwmd server.
