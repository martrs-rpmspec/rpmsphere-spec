Summary:        A wrapper library for D-Bus services
Version:        2.16
Release:        1
Source:         libosso-%{version}.tar.bz2

%description
Libosso is the basic library containing required and helpful functions
for maemo applications. One of Libosso's main features is RPC (Remote
Procedure Calls) services (as it "wraps" D-Bus). In addition, Libosso
provides access to low-level hardware functions, such as turning on (or
keeping on) the display, autosaving, state saving and system time.

All maemo-compliant applications must use Libosso to respond coherently
to system changes and signals, such as the battery low, pre-shutdown
and state saving signals.

This package contains the shared library.
