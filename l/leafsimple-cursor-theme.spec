%description
leafSimple is a X11 mouse theme multisized to 24, 32, 40, 48, 56 and 64 pixels,
for both: righties and lefties. It is dedicated to Linux Mint Petra with Cinnamon
as desktop environment. I want to thank Brahim Salem, who is a member of this
website, for his contribution with ideas for the conclusion of this project.
