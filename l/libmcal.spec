%description
mcal stands for Modular Calendar Access Library. libmcal is a C library
for accessing calendars, written to be very modular, with pluggable drivers.
One of the main drivers it handles is ICAP, an internet protocol that has
very close ties with the IMAP protocol. Using ICAP, you can access a calendar
in very much the same way as you use IMAP to access a remote mailbox.
