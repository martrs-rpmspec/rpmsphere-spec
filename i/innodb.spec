%description
Made for application developers, device makers and ISVs, Embedded InnoDB
provides all the high-performance, proven and reliable data management features
of InnoDB in an embeddable form, without the overhead, footprint or unneeded
features of the MySQL server.

Embedded InnoDB is used independently of MySQL. It is not a plugin, nor a
storage engine for MySQL. It is designed to be linked directly into application
programs, and provides highly efficient, low-level database management
services, not using SQL.

Embedded InnoDB provides the features, functions and capabilities that embedded
applications require:

  * Embedded InnoDB delivers all the high-performance and reliability
    capabilities of the InnoDB storage engine, including concurrency control,
    sophisticated indexing, crash recovery and more.
  * For application programmers, Embedded InnoDB provides a non-SQL, ISAM-like
    API for creating and querying tables and executing other data management
    functions.
  * Designed for use in environments without a database administrator, Embedded
    InnoDB configuration is fully automatic and has all the operational
    characteristics needed for stand-alone applications and devices.
